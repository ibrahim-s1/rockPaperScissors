# rockPaperScissors
The initial basic logic of the game was easy and I completed it fairly quickly however, there was a bug that somehow fixed itself after I decided to restart the game on a new file. 

This project took me far too long, mainly due to my anxiety around coding and starting the work however, after completing it I realised that it was a much-needed experience as I have learnt that "being lost" is okay and that googling is actually encouraged.

My goals now are to get more projects done before I move on to async in order to solidify my knowledge.

I can't take full credit for this work as I have copied the design of this from another user in spite of that, I have not looked at the code rather just visual inspiration. 

# rockPaperScissors UI
While creating the UI, I was surprised to learn that I still needed to google things and that I didn't remember everything I learned from the landing page I created a couple of months back however, these minor setbacks led me to learn that there's more than one way to get the footer to stick to the bottom of the page and that I won't perfect my skills overnight. Hopefully more practice will lead to the desired result.

# improvements 
I need to come back to this project to create a pop-up reset button, the only reason why I'm not doing it now is that, I need to move on and the quality of the project is sufficient for now.
