# rockPaperScissors UI
After ten days of fear and procrastination, I finally created the UI for this project. 

While creating the UI, I was surprised to learn that I still needed to google things and that I didn't remember everything I learned from the landing page I created a couple of months back however, these minor setbacks led me to learn that there's more than one way to get the footer to stick to the bottom of the page and that I won't perfect my skills overnight. Hopefully more practice will lead to the desired result.
